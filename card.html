				Highland cattle are a Scottish cattle breed. They have long horns and
				long wavy coats that are coloured black, brindle, red, yellow, white or silver.
				They originated in the Highlands and Western Isles of Scotland and were first
				mentioned in the 6th century AD. The first herd book described two distinct
				types of Highland cattle but, due to crossbreeding between the two, only one
				type now exists.
